# Grasshopper-to-Arduino Communication Project

## Overview
This project enables seamless communication between Grasshopper and Arduino to control sensors, actuators, and other hardware in real time.

## Key Features
- Real-time communication via serial or plugins (Firefly, GHowl).
- Modular Grasshopper scripts for data processing and visualization.
- Comprehensive Arduino integration with easy configuration.

## Repository Structure
- `GrasshopperFiles/`: Grasshopper scripts for controlling Arduino.
- `ArduinoFiles/`: Arduino sketches, configurations, and libraries.
- `HardwareIntegration/`: Wiring diagrams, component details, and setup instructions.
- `Data/`: Input/output data and logs for testing.
- `Docs/`: Documentation for installation, usage, and troubleshooting.

For more details, see the [Documentation](./Docs/).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/GrasshopperArduinoCommunication.git
